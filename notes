notes
	subBytes
		byte-by-byte substitution in forward process
		16 x 16 lookup table to find replacement byte for a given byte in the input array
		x-out = A * x' + c
			c byte is 0x63
			for each block in state box
			1. convert to hex
			2. lookup in s-box, use this as the replacement
	shiftRows
		shifting the row of the state array during the forward process
		scramble the byte order inside each 128-bit block
		*causes each bit of the ciphertext to rely on every bit fo the plain-text after 10 rounds
		1. first row doesn't change
		2. second row shifts one byte
		3. 2 bytes
		4. 3 bytes
	mixColumns
		mixing up of the bytes in each column separately during the forward process
		further scramble up the 128-bit input block
		*causes each bit of the ciphertext to rely on every bit fo the plain-text after 10 rounds
		
	addRoundKey
		adding the round key to the output of the previous step during the forward process
